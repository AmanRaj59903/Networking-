A compound-complex sentence is a sentence that has:

1. At least two independent clauses (complete sentences), and


2. At least one dependent clause (an incomplete sentence that needs the main one to make sense).



👉 In short:
Compound sentence + Complex sentence = Compound-Complex sentence

(Independent clause) + (Coordinating conjunction + Independent clause) + (Subordinating clause)

Coordinating conjunctions: and, but, or, so, yet, for, nor
Subordinating conjunctions: because, although, when, if, since, while, etc.
